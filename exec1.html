		 1.1 A BRIEF HISTORY
 A network is a group of connected, communicating devices such as computers and
 printers. An internet (note the lowercase i) is two or more networks that can communi
cate with each other. The most notable internet is called the Internet (uppercase I),
 composed of hundreds of thousands of interconnected networks. Private individuals as
 well as various organizations such as government agencies, schools, research facilities,
 corporations, and libraries in more than 100 countries use the Internet. Millions
 of people are users. Yet this extraordinary communication system only came into being
 in 1969.<br/><br/>
 <b><i><u>ARPANET</b></i></u>
In 1967, at an <mark> Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) </mark>meeting, ARPA pre
sented its ideas for ARPANET, a small network of connected computers. The idea was
 that each host computer (not necessarily from the same manufacturer) would be
 attached to a specialized computer, called an interface message processor (IMP). The
 IMPs, in turn, would be connected to each other. Each IMP had to be able to communi
cate with other IMPs as well as with its own attached host.
 By 1969, <del>ARPANET</del> was a reality. Four nodes, at the University of California at
 Los Angeles (UCLA), the University of California at Santa Barbara (UCSB), Stanford
 Research Institute (SRI), and the University of Utah, were connected via the IMPs to
 form a network. Software called the Network Control Protocol (NCP) provided com
munication between the hosts.<hr color="aqua" size=6/>

		Congestion Detection: Multiplicative Decrease
 If congestion occurs, the congestion window size must be decreased. The only way a sender
 can guess that congestion has occurred is the need to retransmit a segment. This is a major
 assumption made by TCP. Retransmission is needed to recover a missing packet which is
 assumed to have been dropped (i.e., lost) by a router that had so many incoming packets,
 that had to drop the missing segment, i.e., the router/network became overloaded or con
gested. However, retransmission can occur in one of two cases: when the RTO timer times
 out or when three duplicate ACKs are received.
